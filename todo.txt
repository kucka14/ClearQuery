get rid of any use of dot notation (account for quotation mark problems)

make sure always copying complex objects when necessary

have an explicit list and dict types (refactor code to use dict instead of object?)

right now, eval of the string will not do things like get all the matching terms in array
    consider adding this functionality
    this should also apply to include clauses (consider need for .any(), .all(), .match(), etc)
        need to be able to match multiple conditions to a single object in an array (but any of the objects)
        but also match if some combination of the objects in the array meet the multiple conditions
    consider using existing python eval syntax whenever possible

think of other ways to deal with missing and null values

consider cacheing values sometimes

for UI, should be able to create arbitrary sequence of the main operation types 
    these operations should appear as a sequence of aligned boxes
    subquery boxes would be indented, subquery-subqueries would be double-indented, etc
