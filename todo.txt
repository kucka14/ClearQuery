make sure always copying complex objects when necessary

think of other ways to deal with missing and null values

consider caching values sometimes

for UI, should be able to create arbitrary sequence of operations
    these operations should appear as a stack of aligned boxes
    subquery boxes would be indented, subquery-subqueries would be double-indented, etc
